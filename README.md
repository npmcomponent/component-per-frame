# Per Frame

Executes a function at most once per animation frame. Kind of like throttle, but it throttles at ~60Hz.

## Example

```js
var throttle = require('per-frame')

var el = document.querySelector('#something')
var fn = throttle(function () {
  el.style.width = (window.innerWidth / 2) + 'px'
})
window.addEventListener('resize', fn)
```

## API

### var callback = throttle(fn, [immediate])

`fn` is the function to be throttled. `callback` is `fn` throttled. Unless `immediate` is `false`, `fn` will be executed immediately.
